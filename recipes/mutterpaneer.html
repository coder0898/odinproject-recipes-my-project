    <h2>Desciption:</h2>
    <p>Matar translates to green peas in Hindi and paneer is Indian cottage cheese. Both ingredients are cooked in an
        onion-tomato gravy with Indian spices. This easy paneer recipe is a widely popular North Indian dish that pairs
        perfectly with roti, paratha, puris, or Jeera Rice. </p>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <p>SAUTE THE PANEER</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat up a nonstick pan on medium heat, and add 1 tablespoon oil. </li>
        <li>Once hot, add cubed paneer.</li>
        <li>Saute the paneer for 2-3 minutes max until it's light golden brown. DO NOT OVERCOOK THE PANEER, or else
            it'll become rubbery.</li>
        <li>Once done, transfer the paneer onto a plate with a paper towel. This will remove some of that excess oil.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>COOK MATAR PANEER</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a pan on medium heat, once hot, add oil. Then add cumin seeds, green cardamom, and cloves. Saute for
            about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Next add the sliced green chilies. Saute for 30 seconds or so. </li>
        <li>Add the red onions and season with salt. Stir. Allow the onions to cook for about 3-5 minutes or until
            golden. Stir occasionally. You may need to add a Â¼ cup of water to deglaze the pan.</li>
        <li>Now add the grated ginger and garlic.</li>
        <li>Stir and saute for a minute.</li>
        <li>Add the pureed tomatoes. Stir for a minute.</li>
        <li>Add the ground spices - turmeric powder, Kashmiri chili powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and
            salt. Stir well.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook for 15 minutes or low-medium heat until you have a paste-like consistency.</li>
        <li>This is what you are looking for - a paste-like consistency. This step is important so make sure the result is like a tomato paste with no more liquid.</li>
        <li>Add a cup of water. Stir well.</li>
        <li>Add the green peas. Stir.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook for 4-5 minutes on low-medium heat.</li>

        <li>Garnish with lots of fresh cilantro.</li>
